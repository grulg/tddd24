1. 

4. A DBMS is system that takes care of reading and writing (probably in parallell) to a database, often with utilities for recovery and is located on its own separate server (software wise, maybe not physically on a separate server). SQLite is more light weight than other databases, but has some restrictions (like only one writer at a time), as utilizes a single database file to store everything.
